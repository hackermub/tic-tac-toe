# tic-tac-toe
First ever practice "Project" I created. A console based tic-tac-toe game.

# 1.c
This was coded in November 20,2016. This was the same year of my first programming contest NHSPC. After my JSC exam, I got some free time and coded this and uploaded the code in a Facebook page of mine called "C Z S programming club", a page for my schools unofficial coding club. I retrieved this code from that post and ran it, and surprise surprise, it doesn't work

# 2.cpp
So, first thing I switched to cpp from c and changed the chars to strings and modified some printf and scanfs for that. I added some empty lines to make the code look cleaner. Added a clearscrean command in the beginning of the main function. While compiling, got an error that says the condition function reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type], so added return 0 at the end of it. Also removed an unnecesarry count=0 line
